# Generic Board Game

The Generic Board Game project, developed with C#, allows users to play various board games, including Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4. It provides options for player vs. player, player vs. computer, and computer vs. computer gameplay. The computer opponent utilizes the minimax algorithm with randomization for decision-making.

## Games Included
Currently, the project includes the following games:
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Connect 4

## Gameplay Options
Players can choose from the following gameplay options:
- Player vs. Player: Two human players can compete against each other.
- Player vs. Computer: A human player can play against the computer opponent.
- Computer vs. Computer: Two computer players can compete against each other (Looks fun so I kept it).

## Computer Opponent
The computer opponent in each game is implemented using the minimax algorithm. It prioritizes winning moves and randomizes its move if there are multiple moves with the same value.
